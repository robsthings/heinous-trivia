# Side Quest Assets

This directory contains static assets for each side quest mini-game.

## Folder Structure

Each side quest has its own folder containing:
- Background images (JPG/PNG)
- Character sprites (PNG with transparency)
- UI elements and icons
- Game-specific graphics

## Asset Guidelines

- Use consistent naming conventions: `background.png`, `sprite-character.png`
- Optimize images for web (compress without quality loss)
- Maintain aspect ratios for responsive design
- Use transparent PNGs for sprites and UI elements
- Follow horror aesthetic consistent with main game
