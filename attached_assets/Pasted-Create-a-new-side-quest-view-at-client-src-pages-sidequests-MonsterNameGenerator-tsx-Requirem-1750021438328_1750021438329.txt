Create a new side quest view at:  
client/src/pages/sidequests/MonsterNameGenerator.tsx

Requirements:

🧠 STRUCTURE:
- Display full-screen using the background image:
  /sidequests/monster-name-generator/monster-library-bg.png
- Overlay centered card frame:
  /sidequests/monster-name-generator/monster-card.png
- Position Dr. Heinous sprite (optional, like heinousSprites.charming) near the side

🔍 SCAN PHASE:
- Begin with a fake loading sequence that lasts ~4 seconds before revealing the name
- Center a glowing animated scan bar that moves vertically down the card area
- Cycle through the following scanning phrases (1 per second, fade in or typewriter style):
  1. Scanning Subject...
  2. Analyzing Bone Structure...
  3. Detecting Curses...
  4. Soul Searching...
  5. Monster Name Acquired!

💡 SCAN BAR:
- Use animated CSS if no scan bar asset exists
- Should loop vertically over the card until scan completes

🧛 MONSTER NAME GENERATION:
- After scan completes, generate and display a monster name
- Monster names = [Adjective] + [Creature], e.g. "Gloopy Fiend", "Cryptic Lurker"
- Pull from two internal arrays:
  adjectives = ["Gloopy", "Cryptic", "Snarling", "Chittering", "Pustulent", "Barbed", "Doomed", "Festering"]
  creatures = ["Fiend", "Ghoul", "Wretch", "Lurker", "Wailer", "Banshee", "Beast", "Goblyn"]
- Format as large stylized text centered on the card

📸 SCREENSHOT MOMENT:
- Below the name, show a button: "📸 Save Your Monster Card"
- On click, use `html2canvas` to screenshot the visible card area and download as PNG
- Optional: brief flash effect when saving

🎭 REPLAY BUTTON:
- Below screenshot button, show: "🔁 Generate Another"
- Clicking it resets the scan and starts again

🧪 OPTIONAL:
- Allow an optional prop like `showHeinous: true` to toggle character presence
- Animate Heinous in with a floating speech bubble: “Hold still. This won’t hurt… much.”

Routing:
- Add this route to `App.tsx` as: `/sidequest/monster-name-generator`
