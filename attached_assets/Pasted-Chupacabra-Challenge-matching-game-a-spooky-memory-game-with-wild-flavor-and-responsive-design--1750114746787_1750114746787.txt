Chupacabra Challenge matching game (a spooky memory game with wild flavor and responsive design):

🔧 Prompt 1 — Scaffold Chupacabra Challenge Page
Prompt:

Create a new page at client/src/pages/ChupacabraChallenge.tsx.
This is a cryptid-themed memory game. Use the background image at /sidequests/chupacabra-challenge/challenge-bg.png to fill the screen.
Center a 4x4 grid of cards using the goat-themed card back (card-back.png).
On click, cards flip to reveal one of 8 matching card faces (card-1.png through card-8.png).
There should be two of each card face. Shuffle cards randomly on each load.
Add subtle flip animation on reveal, and a delay on mismatches before flipping back.
Limit the number of cards flipped at once to 2.
Track matched pairs and end the game when all 8 pairs are matched.
Show a “Play Again” and “Return to Main Game” button at the end.
All assets are in /public/sidequests/chupacabra-challenge/.

🎨 Prompt 2 — Add Chupacabra Reactions
Prompt:

On the Chupacabra Challenge page, add two image overlays of Chupacabra:

/chupacabra/chupacabra-2.png for when the player flips the wrong pair

/chupacabra/chupacabra-4.png for when the player makes a correct match
Position these near the corner of the screen.
When a match is made, show the “scheming” image for 2 seconds with a taunting CSS pulse or glow.
When a mismatch is made, show the “taunting” version briefly.
Only one Chupacabra image should appear at a time.
Hide them when no reaction is active.

🧠 Prompt 3 — Add Game State + Match Logic
Prompt:

Add React state logic to track:

flippedCards: number[] — indices of currently flipped cards

matched: Set<number> — indices of cards that have been matched

attempts counter
Prevent flipping a 3rd card while 2 are revealed.
After 1 second, auto-hide unmatched cards.
When all cards are matched, show an overlay with a congratulatory message:
"You've survived the Chupacabra Challenge!"
Add buttons: "Play Again" (resets game), "Return to Main Game" (navigates to /game/:hauntId).

🖼 Prompt 4 — Card Flip Animation & Style Polish
Prompt:

Add card flip animations using CSS.
Each card should appear as a rectangular tile with a front (card-back) and back (card face).
On hover, if clickable, use a subtle cursor and highlight.
Flip animation should trigger when card is revealed.
Matched cards should stay visible and get a green glow border.
Mismatched cards get a red border for a moment before hiding.
Use mobile-first responsive layout: cards should stack slightly tighter on small screens.
